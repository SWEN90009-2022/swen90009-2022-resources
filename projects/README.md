## Project Overview

The aim of this subject is to give students an understanding of the theoretical and technical principles behind systems analysis and software requirements engineering, applying techniques in a real-world project environment to analyse the requirements for systems. The subject is core in the MC-ENG Master of Engineering (Software) degree.

The first step in the development of any non-trivial software system is an analysis of the problem domain in order to formulate a requirements specification. In this subject students will explore the aims, principles, processes and techniques involved in business and domain analysis and the formulation of requirements for real clients. 

## Application Domain

Projects available this semester:

- [Creative Learning Units](1_project.md)
- [Genyus Network - Facebook](2_project.md)
- [CoachingMate Workout Builder](3_project.md)
- [Canvas Dashboards](4_project.md)
- [Telstra - Security Data Normalization](5_project.md)
- [Study Buddies](6_travel_system.md)

## Programming Language and Architecture

The technology in this subject is project-dependent.

However, all design diagrams (domain model, class diagram, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams) must be in UML.

## Plagiarism

All code and documentation submitted as part of this project must be your own team’s work, it must be based on your own 
knowledge and skills. Collaboration between (internal or external) teams is not allowed, if we find that a submission has been copied from the 
work of another team, all students submitting the copied work will receive zero marks for the assignment. Similarities 
will be determined by Turnitin and others.

## Teams

This assignment will be carried out in teams of 4 or 5, no exceptions. 

This is a semester long project that will require constant interaction and contribution from all team members, we 
strongly encourage you to create your own teams and make a conscious choice of whom you will be working with. 

## Use of Code Repositories and Collaborative Tools

For this project, we will adopt GitHub Classroom. Your team will be created by the teaching team and will be available
here: [view](https://github.com/SWEN90009-2022) (you’ll be able to access this space once you receive our invitation in 
Week 2). After that, you’ll be able to create your private repositories. **Your repository must be kept as private**.

Once your team and repository are created, we strongly encourage you to explore the Discussions and the Projects tab 
available on your GitHub Team space.

This repository must be used for the duration of your project to manage source code and related configuration items. 
You should also use it to store a copy of your design documentation (e.g., class diagrams) and the reports submitted for 
each stage. Make sure you structure your repository properly.

Example of repository structure:
````
├── docs/            # Docs (you can create subfolders to organize your project reports and minutes)   
├──├── requirements/   # design or inception sprint  
├──├── architecture    # architecture docs/diagrams
├──├── tests/          # tests
├──├──data-samples/  # Data (inputs) necessary to simulate/demonstrate your project   
├── src/             # Source code   
└── README.md
````

README file must explain your GitHub repository: what’s included, link to your deployed App, changelog, details about 
team members and so on.

At the end of each deliverable, generate a RELEASE TAG from your repository (master branch).
Format: SWEN90009\_2022\_Sprint<number>\_<team name>

Keep in mind that your Git repository will also be used to assess individual contributions. This means that it is very 
important that you commit and push your work frequently. It is also good practice to do this as it protects your work 
from accidental crashes or deletions!

For your submission reports, you are free to choose a collaboration mode that works best for your team. We suggest using 
GitHub Teams, it facilitates teamwork, stores copies of your work, and keeps a log of individual contributions to the 
document. This may come in handy during the peer review process if disputes about contributions arise in the team.

## Peer Review

During this journey, students will be asked to participate in two peer assessment survey (after Sprint1 and after Sprint3).

This is an individual mandatory task. Everyone needs to participate, assess and provide feedback to peers. Regardless 
of having a great or bad team experience, students will be encouraged to provide feedback. The survey shouldn't take 
students longer than 10 minutes to be completed. Students’ guidelines for peer review will be provided in the LMS.
