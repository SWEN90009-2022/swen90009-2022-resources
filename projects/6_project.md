# Study Buddies

**App Design: Study buddies**

Chris Honig and Eduardo Oliveira

COVID-19 has fundamentally shifted University teaching. Post-pandemic, it is likely students will always expect online equivalents of lectures and tutorials. But how will this change the needs for on-campus experiences? For example do we want library-like study spaces, where students work silently and individually, as they would at home? Or would we prefer to facilitate co-working, collaborative environments? Start-up incubators (like WeWork) leverage the expertise of other people in the space: If you’re struggling with a 2nd  year subject problem, there might be a 3rd  year student sitting right next to you who has done the subject before. How can we spark this connection, and facilitate the free flow of information? Does tech (like social media) afford us this opportunity? Proximity based skills pairing has applications beyond just Universities, in all co-working spaces; post-pandemic, these spaces likely to grow given new decentralized remote-working expectations.

This project will develop and test a social-media app to match peer mentors and study buddies by subject history. If a minimum viable product can be built, it will be tested in the Faculty of Engineering and IT at UoM. The goal of the App is to facilitate student cohort experience, help students make friends in similar courses and improve overall learning by encouraging and connecting volunteer tutors to other students.

The minimum viable product you will build may include the following features (I’m very open to discussion and collaboration with student applicants):

-   A short personal bio with a photo
-   A drop-down list selection of subjects students are taking at UoM
-   An option to select “seeking help” or “offering help” or both
-   A pairing system to select students within a subject or between years

Additional features might include:

-   A messaging system in App
-   A geolocation marker to find study buddies in the same library
-   Incognito options to block students
-   A UoM sign-in (creates more accountability than other social-media apps)
-   In app reward systems for volunteer tutors such as scoring towards LiCA recognition, faculty awards or user-purchased rewards (eg coffee vouchers or a Reddit gold star system).
