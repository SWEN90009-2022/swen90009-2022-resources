_Introduction_

It is with a sense of excitement that I share with you the information below about Creative Learning Units. We have been working with the ideas underpinning this new unit design framework for more than a decade, with various groups of school teachers studying at the University. And in addition to schooling, the framework also has applicability in university teaching, where a university subject is basically a unit of work/study.

There is a deeper foundation of existential philosophy underpinning this unit design framework that I can share with you via this university subject/project. This foundation is the main reason why Creative Learning Units offer an advance in unit design, because founded on a learning theory that is itself grounded in understandings of human experience.

A further advance that we would like to pursue is in the operationalising of this unit design framework. Teachers will engage with the framework, at least initially, not as a philosophical statement, but as a series of working templates where they input their information in specific ways. As has been the case for many years with all unit design frameworks, these templates are two dimensional and presented in what is basically a linear sequence.

However, the unit design process is more complex than this, and would benefit greatly from support via an online integrated process, which enables the forwards and backwards movements inherent to unit design to be engaged with authentically. This is where your support will be invaluable, as you can design this online process environment which teachers can engage with, while at the same time they learn how Creative Learning Units work.

_Problem domain – teaching and learning_

The problem here is in the domain of teaching and learning. Teaching presents a conundrum, primarily because the aim of teaching is to influence someone else’s learning. How does a person influence another person? How is a person influenced by another person? These questions reach into every aspect of human relations and experiences and raise all the issues of teaching and learning. In other words, teaching and learning concerns people:  _who_  they are and can be.

Yet many teachers don’t often talk about teaching practice in this way, instead referring to curriculum and pedagogy as the principal concerns.  _What_  (curriculum) will be taught/learnt?  _How_  will this (curriculum) be taught/learnt? Curriculum is considered the basis of teaching and learning, with pedagogy supporting its achievement.  _Who_  the people are is important, but not as important as curriculum/pedagogy, resulting in a disconnect for some or many.

_Unit design frameworks_

Curriculum and pedagogy are discussed and thought about in the planning that teachers do for teaching and learning. Such planning draws curriculum and pedagogy into units of study (for example, a university subject) comprising a series of lessons with assessment tasks. Planning of units is informed by  _unit design frameworks_, whether implicitly or explicitly. Examples of well-known unit design frameworks include inquiry-based units (Wilson and Wing Jan, 2009) and backward design units (Wiggins and McTighe, 2005). These frameworks bring curriculum and pedagogy together in actual teaching and learning situations.

Backward design is based on the idea that “the best designs derive backward from the learnings sought” (Wiggins and McTighe, 2005, p. 14). It is this directional logic, “the reverse of common practice” (p. 17), that is advocated; where teachers “start with a much more careful statement of the desired results.” These are the learning goals. So the three stages for designing a unit in this way are: (1) identify desired results, (2) determine acceptable evidence, and (3) plan learning experiences and instruction. Noticeably, these stages are instructional for teachers, referring chiefly to teacher actions.

Inquiry-based design can be contrasted with backward design via this directional logic.

Inquiry is forward design. Hence “inquiry is not activities predetermined by the teacher linked by a predetermined focus, topic or theme” (Wilson and Wing Jan, 2009, p. 8). Rather, “it is a collaborative process in which both students and teachers work together, often, to negotiate aspects of the curriculum” (p. 8). So the three stages for designing a unit in this way are: (1) tuning in, (2) finding out and sorting out, and (3) reflection and action. Noticeably, these stages are instructional for teachers but refer chiefly to the actions of students.

The differing directional logic of these unit frameworks – forward and backward – highlights the importance of both and the need to develop a more comprehensive unit design framework. Both teachers and students work forward and backward; backward is not just for teachers and forward not just for students.

**_Creative Learning Unit design framework_**

This awareness refocuses attention on the aim of teaching: to influence someone else’s learning. As well as designing with the technical concerns of curriculum (what) and pedagogy (how), unit design frameworks articulate relationships between teachers and learners. In this sense they address not only  _what_  will be taught/learnt and  _how_  this will be taught/learnt, but  _who_  is involved in this teaching/learning.

The labels “teacher” and “student” are ubiquitous in discussions of curriculum and pedagogy. They acknowledge who is involved but do so in a simplified and schematic way, suggesting that in any teaching and learning situation, teacher and student are the only two occupations of relevance.

If the relationship is construed only in this way – as between teacher and student occupations – then the scope for influence is limited. The limitation derives from the occupational restriction; the perception that teaching and learning can involve only these two main occupations. And yet human experience is so much richer than being a student. Therefore, unit design must work more explicitly with  _who_  and not just with  _what_  and  _how_.

The word occupation is used here deliberately because it draws who-how-what together. For example: being a teacher (who) involves doing things a teacher does (how) and knowing things a teacher knows (what). But an occupation can be much more than just an adult job, as being a student demonstrates. Drawing on the notion that occupations, as Dewey (1916) argued, are more than just adult jobs (Quay, 2015), and introducing this understanding into thinking about unit design, means that a unit design framework must take on the further dimension of engaging with occupational characteristics, with  _who_. This is a third dimension to those of curriculum (_what_) and pedagogy (_how_), offering a three dimensional (3D) engagement, by acknowledging the depth which occupational awareness brings.

This 3D engagement is at the heart of creative learning units (CLUs), a unit design framework that emphasizes the importance of  _what_  will be taught/learnt,  _how_  this will be taught/learnt, and  _who_  is involved in this teaching/learning. In more active terms this is knowing, doing and being (Quay, 2015). These three are related as three dimensions of experience: all three are there in every experience, in every occupation. CLUs are a new expression of unit design which expands teaching and learning to embed  _who_, and in doing this opens this  _who_  to more than just being a student.
