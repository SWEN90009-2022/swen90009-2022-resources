# Canvas Dashboards

**Paula de Barba and Eduardo Oliveira**

Canvas is a learning management system that can provide great features to help students learn. However, one important feature is missing: a dashboard for students that allows them to review and reflect on their learning skills. In this project, we will  **develop a student facing dashboard in Canvas** so students can visualize how they are accessing, interacting, and performing in a subject.

This is a product designed from students and to students.

This project involves learning analytics and the development of dashboards/visualizations to support students.

Here, you will have the chance to work with educational experts from the  [Melbourne Graduate School of Education](https://education.unimelb.edu.au/).

In this project you'll use Canvas API [https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi]
