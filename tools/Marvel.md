## Before you start
- If you want to invite your team members to your workspace, keep in mind that for a free account, you can have 6 people in TOTAL (including yourself!) to **edit** the workspace projects. 
- Using a free account, you only get ONE editable project. Keep that in mind before you create a second project!


## Sign up
1. Follow [this link](https://marvelapp.com/) to create an Marvel account.
2. During your sign up process, Marvel might ask you to create your first Marvel Whiteboard. You can choose "Skip for now" to ignore this option, because what you will be needing is NOT a whiteboard. (IMAGE HERE) 


## Create your first project
1. After you have signed up, you can "Create project". (IMAGE 1)
2. There will be options to choose from - select the "Prototype" option. (IMAGE 2)
3. Then, enter the project name.
4. Do you know if your client wants a web-application, or a mobile app? If it is a web-application, will the users mostly access this web-app via their phone, or laptop/computer? Select a device accordingly. In this tutorial, we will go with iPhone 12. (IMAGE 3)
5. Create project.


## Prototyping
- Once you have created your project, you can start prototyping! There are two stages to create your paper prototype:
  1. Design your screens - what are they going to look like?   
  2. Design the interactions and transitions between your screens. 

- Marvel offers three main ways to design your screens:
  1. Create your own design on Marvel.
  2. If you have got some design already, you can upload your design in Marvel.
  3. Use the template that Marvel provides.

- Marvel has a good [tutorial](https://help.marvelapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002536038) to help you get started with designing your screens and the interactions between screens - make sure to check it out!


## Tips
- Make sure that you hide hotspot hints ([instructions](https://help.marvelapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002746798-How-to-hide-hotspot-hints-when-playing-prototypes)) when testing your prototype with end-users/clients. Remember, one of the goals of paper prototype is to test the usability of your design. If you don't hide hotspot hints, end-users/clients will be given clues to know where to click, making it more difficult for you to know if your system has a high level of usability. If your client can navigate around smoothly - is it because you designed the system well, or is it due to the hints?

- It is likely that you will create A LOT of screens for your paper prototype. You can organise your screens into **sections** on Marvel. Checkout this series of short [tutorials](https://help.marvelapp.com/hc/en-us/sections/360001413858-Organising-designs-with-sections) on sections.
