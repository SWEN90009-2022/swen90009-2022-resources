## do/be/feel
Create a do/be/feel list for the project as described in the lecture. It will cover both the artefact itself and the process followed to create it. You may want to document the process as well (considering the lectures from Professor Leon about the Motivational Modelling tool)

do/be/feel:
| Criteria | Quality attributes |
| --- | --- |
| Granularity | The list has an adequate level of granularity that helps understand and explain the context of the project. |
| Complete | The do/be/feel list completely covers the information elicited during the session and other interactions with the client. **DO-BE-FEEL list and DO-BE-FEEL hierarchy are well presented.** |
| Consistency | The do/be/feel is consistent with the client understanding of the problem and with other artefacts.  |



## Goal Model
Create a goal model for the project as described in the lecture. **Your goal model MUST be consistent to your do/be/feel list.** Note that the validation with the client can happen after this submission, possibly during the co-design session with the client in Week 6.

Goal model:
| Criteria | Quality attributes |
| --- | --- |
| Granularity | The goal model has an adequate level of granularity that helps understand and explain the context of the project and its motivation. It shows well the goals of the system to be develop to a level of detail similar to user stories. The level of granularity allows for a correct association of quality and emotional goals to particular functional goals. |
| Hierarchy structure | The hierarchy of functional goals makes perfectly sense for somebody not familiar with the problem domain and it can be followed to explain and motivate the problem to an external party. |
| Use of elements | The notation has been followed and the elements have been used correctly. |
| Complete | The goal model completely covers the information elicited during the session and other interactions with the client. DO-BE-FEEL list and DO-BE-FEEL hierarchy are presented together with the model. |
| Consistency | The goal model is consistent with the client understanding of the problem and with **DO-BE-FEEL list and DO-BE-FEEL hierarchy.**  |
| Presentation | The goal model has an elegant and neat layout, including clarity (labels and spelling).  |



## Persona
Create a set of personas for your project as described in the lecture. There is no predetermined number of personas required. It will vary between projects, in case of doubt discuss with your supervisor. There is no enforced format for the personas, you may choose your own design as long as covers all important aspects. Usage of personas will be observed by your supervisor through the rest of the subject.

Personas:
| Criteria | Quality attributes |
| --- | --- |
| Realistic | The personas are based on the research done by students and the discussion with the clients. |
| Range | The personas represent a sufficiently wide range of behaviours of target users for the system. There is evidence that a variety of types of personas have been considered.

**Map interview subjects (users) to behavioral variables (constructing personas - step 2)** |
| Distinct | The personas present distinct behaviours and do not overlap (unless justified by the students). |
| Usefulness | 	The personas present a rich description of the users and give a good understanding of the person's motivation and behaviour. |
| Presentation | The presentation of the personas is elegant and attractive, they are well written, clear, without ambiguities or typos. |
| Process | There is evidence that the process to create personas has been followed and it has been well documented. |
