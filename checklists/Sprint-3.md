## Sprint 3 Deliverables
At the end of this sprint, you need to deliver:

- [ ] **User Stories**
    - Make sure your clients agree with the user stories prioritisation in general. If you need some guidance on prioritisation, make sure you ask the client. 
    - Consistency is KEY. Make sure your user stories are consistent with your Goal Model and personas.
    - Make sure you have proofread it to check for spelling errors and typos.
    - Make sure you have read the marking criteria on Canvas, and check your work with the marking criteria.

- [ ] **User Journey Map**
    - If you have missed it, the User Journey Map is listed INSIDE the marking criteria of the User Stories. 
    - Make sure your user journey maps cover at least 2 scenarios.
    - Tip: Remember, the user journeys tie back to the personas you created. In your user journey maps, you don't have to provide users' background again if you already mentioned it in the personas. You can link to the personas' page instead. (Think about your readers: is there too much information contained in your map? Would it be difficult for your supervisor to read it? Any repeated information?)
    - Make sure you have proofread it to check for spelling errors and typos.

- [ ] **User Story Map**
    - If you have missed it, the User Story Map is listed INSIDE the marking criteria of the User Stories.
    - Remember, SWEN90014 students from Semester 2 will read your User Story Map to guide their release planning. Imagine you are a student in SWEN90014: 
        - Does the User Story Map make sense? Do you need some justifications/explanations to understand certain decisions?
        - Is the amount of work in each release feasible? 
    - Make sure you have proofread it to check for spelling errors and typos.

- [ ] **Paper Prototype**
    - Make sure you have written down clients' feedback for your usability test on Confluence (You will need it for your digital prototype :grinning:).
    - Make sure the scenarios in your paper prototype are connected with your user stories/Goal Model/personas, for consistency.
    - Make sure you have carefully read the instructions and marking criteria on Canvas - the devil is in the detail :wink:

- [ ] **GitHub**
    - Make sure you have read the marking criteria on Canvas, and check your work with the marking criteria.


## Previous sprint deliverables
- [ ] How did you go with your Sprint 2 assessment? Were your do/be/feel list, Goal Model and personas consistent with one another? Any feedback from your supervisor? Remember to update your artefacts according to the feedback you received.
