# Software Engineering tools used in CIS

We use a variety of supportive tools in SE:

**1) Atlassian Toolset**

We run the following tools on servers hosted in the  [Melbourne School of Engineering](http://www.eng.unimelb.edu.au/).

You don't need to use the VPN to access EngIT Confluence. (You needed to prior to COVID-19 but it was made available outside of the VPN due to access issues for some students.) You may need to tell the browser to proceed, despite a security warning.

-   JIRA - Project Management & Issue Tracking:  [https://jira.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8444/](https://jira.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8444/)
-   Confluence - Knowledge Sharing & Documentation Software :  [https://confluence.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8443/](https://confluence.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8443/)
-   BitBucket - Git Repository Management :  [https://bitbucket.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8445/](https://bitbucket.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8445/)
-   Bamboo - Continuous Integration toolset :  [https://bamboo.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8446/](https://bamboo.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8446/)
-   Crowd - Group Permissions Management (typically only used by staff) :  [http://crowd.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8095/](http://crowd.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8095/)

Crowd is for identity management; you need to log in with your University of Melbourne credentials to create an account so that you can be given access to the other tools.

In some subjects we use Confluence for team collaboration, JIRA for issue tracking, and BitBucket for version control.

Atlassian also provides [SourceTree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree), a GUI-based front-end for version control for Windows and Mac. It is available for free and is relatively easy to use.

See [https://www.atlassian.com/](https://www.atlassian.com/)  for more details, or  [this page for a brief history](https://www.atlassian.com/company)  (for interest only).

**CONFLUENCE**  
Confluence is a wiki that allows team members to edit, store and access content. In addition, Confluence allows for the setting of permissions to restrict access to specific content or content areas if necessary. In your case, you will find Confluence a useful tool allowing your different team members to share ideas through the adding, editing and storing of content, as you work together on your project work.

To get started its best to learn how to use Confluence using the Atlassian Confluence Demonstration Video on YouTube:[Atlassian Confluence Demonstration Video](http://youtu.be/uhWCMlcY_Zw)

**JIRA**
To find out more about JIRA and what it offers look at the  [documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver071/jira-software-documentation-800706335.html) or one of the many videos available on-line.

**3) Other Version Control:  [Git](http://git.eng.unimelb.edu.au/)  and  [SVN](http://svn.eng.unimelb.edu.au/)**

Git and  [SVN](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/) are software versioning and revision control systems. We run these tools on servers hosted in the [Melbourne School of Engineering](http://www.eng.unimelb.edu.au/).
