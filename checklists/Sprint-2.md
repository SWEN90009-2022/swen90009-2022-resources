## Sprint 2 Deliverables
At the end of this sprint, you need to deliver:

- [ ] **do/be/feel list**
    - Remember, in addition to the artefact itself, you may want to document the process followed to create the list.
    - Make sure all the stakeholders (and only them) are in your list.
    - Make sure it is consistent with the Goal model.
    - Make sure you have proofread it to check for spelling errors and typos.
    - Make sure you have read the marking criteria on Canvas, and check your work with the marking criteria. 

- [ ] **Goal Model**
    - Make sure it is consistent with the do/be/feel list.
    - Do you think you can use this Goal Model to help you explain the project to someone new to the project?  If not, or if you think something is missing, you might want to adjust it.
    - Tip: You can use different colours in your Goal Model to make it even clearer and easier to follow. 
    - Make sure you have proofread it to check for spelling errors and typos.
    - Make sure you have read the marking criteria on Canvas, and check your work with the marking criteria. 

- [ ] **Personas**
    - Make sure your personas are consistent with your do/be/feel list and Goal Model.
    - Is there a stakeholder in your do/be/feel list and Goal Model for whom you did NOT create a Persona?  Can you justify why?  Documenting these decisions/justifications on Confluence helps you keep track of your decisions, and helps supervisors understand your decisions.
    - When you create personas, it can be easy to lose focus and start writing about personal goals that the system you are designing cannot directly help with.  Keep in mind that your focus should be what the user wants to achieve with the system.
    - Make sure you have proofread it to check for spelling errors and typos.
    - Make sure you have read the marking criteria on Canvas, and check your work with the marking criteria. 

- [ ] **GitHub**
    - Make sure you have read the marking criteria on Canvas, and check your work with the marking criteria.

## Previous sprint deliverables
- [ ] By now, you would have met your client. Has your understanding on the project (background, motivation, etc) changed? Do you know more about the project now? Remember to update your Project Overview page on Confluence. (Keep it updated :100:)
- [ ] Remember to make adjustments to your Project Overview/Requirements Elicitation/GitHub based on your supervisor's feedback.
