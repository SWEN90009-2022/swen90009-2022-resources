# Checklist Overview

Some general principles apply in regard to the checklists:

These checklists are fairly generic; it is often appropriate to tailor a checklist for your project or team. You should do this in consultation with your supervisor, and document your decision and the reasons for it in your team space.

The checklists may assign responsibility to a particular team role. This means that the team member in that role is responsible for ensuring that the work necessary for meeting the checklist criteria is understood and allocated; the team is responsible for doing this work.

If you want to understand assessment for this subject, you should read the assessment guide and discuss it with your supervisor or the coordinator. These checklists are provided to give you a list of items to consider in relation to your project. If you expect a good mark just because you believe you can put a tick against each item in these checklists, you have not understood the purpose of these checklists or the way in which your project will be assessed.
