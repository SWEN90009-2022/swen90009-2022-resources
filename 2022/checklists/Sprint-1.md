## Checklist for Confluence
- [ ] There is a page called **Specification** hanging from the root page of your team's Confluence space. (If you have a look at the PAGE TREE, Specification should be a parent page listed there)
- [ ] Inside the **Specification** parent page, there are children pages where the artefacts are documented.
- [ ] The teaching team can easiliy find information in your Confluence space. This will become increasingly important as you create more and more content for this project. 
- [ ] You have started organsing your Confluence Home page - the first page anyone will see when they visit your Confluence space. You would want it to look organised and professional, right?


## Project Overview
The Project Overview accurately and adequately describes:
- [ ] the project background
- [ ] the motivation of the project (why my clients want to initiate this project?)
- [ ] the problem
- [ ] the scope of the solution

Also, make sure that:
- [ ] The Project Overview is written on a sub-page called **Project Overview**, under **Specification** in Confluence.
- [ ] The Project Overview is well structured.
- [ ] The Project Overview contains no typos or spelling errors.
- [ ] The Project Overview has been reviewed by at least one members in the team (preferably someone who did not write it).
- [ ] Pretend you are a semester 2 student (in SWEN90014), and you know nothing about this project. After reading the Project Overview, you have got a good initial understanding of the project: what it is about, what the problem is and what is within the scope of the software solution.


## Requirements Elicitation
The Requirements Elicitation page documents the requirements elicitation technique(s) that you will use in the project. Take interview as an example, the page documents:
- [ ] How your team prepared for the first interview with the clients, including any resources you have used (e.g. any background study?).
- [ ] Interview questions that you would like to ask the clients - it might be a good idea to group them into categories.
- [ ] The overall structure of the interview (you can use your interview questions to guide you).
- [ ] Roles and responsibilities of each team member during the interview.
- [ ] If you have created any other artefacts to help you with your requirements elicitation - feel free to put it there.

Also, make sure that: 
- [ ] The Requirements Elicitation is written on a sub-page called **Requirements Elicitation**, under **Specification** in Confluence.
- [ ] The Requirements Elicitation page contains no typos or spelling errors.
- [ ] The Requirements Elicitation page is well organised.
- [ ] The interview questions are well-suited to your team's project and clients.
- [ ] Your plan for the interview is feasible within the time limit. For example, if you have a LOT of questions that you want to ask the client, you might want to prioritise the more important ones. 


## GitHub 
- [ ] Your GitHub folders are structured according to the instructions on page **Sprint 1: Background, elicitation docs** on Canvas. (Visit Canvas, then visit Assignments -> Sprint 1: Background, elicitation docs. Once you land on this page, scroll down to find a section called **GitHub**)
- [ ] Documents are added into the repository (make sure they are updated and consistent with your Confluence documentation).
- [ ] You have generated a baseline tag for this delivery, following the speficied format on page **Sprint 1: Background, elicitation docs** on Canvas.
- [ ] In the README, a release note has been added (list the branches that were included in this version).
