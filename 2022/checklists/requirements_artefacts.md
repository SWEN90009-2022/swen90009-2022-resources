# Requirements Artefacts

_Context:_  Each project has a requirements space in Confluence and each team has a development space (named after an animal, i.e. Bilby, Quoll or Platypus) in Confluence. The SWEN90009 specs can be found following the paths "SWEN90009 -> Specification_Emu" and "SWEN90009 -> Specification_Koala" from the home page of the "Requirements" space. The product owners from each team are assumed jointly responsible for the project requirements.

_Your aim is to ensure that:_

1.  The Confluence requirements space for a project holds all requirements for all teams doing that project.
2.  There are no requirements in the Confluence development space of a team.
3.  There is a dedicated page in the requirements space for the requirement called “Requirements” that will contain sub-pages for all the requirements artefacts; initially this content will be the resolved requirements, made up of artefacts assembled from the SWEN90006 requirement and reflecting the baseline for the SWEN90014 project.
4.  The requirements should be up-to-date, that is, reflect the current understanding of the project requirements.
5.  In the requirements page there will be a requirements artefact corresponding to each of: background, goal model, personas, user stories (including acceptance criteria), quality requirements, paper prototype[[1]](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/106830/pages/requirements-artefacts?module_item_id=3059898#_ftn1)  and digital prototype.
6.  The requirements page will contain a sub-page called “Requirements resolution” which will list, for each student involved in the resolution process, their name, their team, and (briefly) the part of the process for which they were responsible. This should include the reviewers (from the client and technical perspective) for each team.
7.  The digital prototype will be used in client meetings to illustrate the functionality that will be developed in the following sprint. Comments or feedback from the client must be incorporated into the digital prototype, as it will act as a sounding board and guide the development of the real system, supporting consistency in terms of interaction and look and feel.
8.  Detected issues in the requirements will have notes against them until fixed. The fixing may involve resolving ambiguities with the client.
9.  If a team negotiates a team-specific deviation from the specification with their client (e.g. based on their choice of technology), they should note the nature and details of the deviation in the page of each affected requirements artefact.
10.  [Architectural](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/4706.html#iratings)  and other critical requirements should be explicitly identified. (The way these have been addressed in the architecture should also be clear and explicit.)
11.  Acceptance tests are part of the requirements documentation. (The acceptance session demo conducted at the end of the semester should be drawn from these acceptance tests and  **must**  follow a narrative.)

[[1]](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/106830/pages/requirements-artefacts?module_item_id=3059898#_ftnref1)  The paper prototype video does not need to be updated, because it was a stepping stone to create the digital prototype video.

In addition, we note that as per IEEE Std 830, requirements should be

-   a) Correct;
-   b) Unambiguous;
-   c) Complete;
-   d) Consistent;
-   e) Ranked for importance and/or stability;
-   f) Verifiable;
-   g) Modifiable;
-   h) Traceable.
