# Verification and Validation (V&V)

1.  Testing -- your teams approach to testing should be documented in confluence including:

1.  What are the rules for who will test artefacts the team produces? (For example, is the developer unit testing? Integration testing?System Testing?)
2.  What general approach is required for testing?(E.g. What degree of coverage at the different levels? What degree of automation?)
3.  How are test results to be documented? (Test results should be captured and reproduceable.)
4.  How are test failures to be handled? (Are they all to be logged in JIRA? Should the tester try to fix bugs first?)

3.  Reviewing -- your teams approach to reviewing should be documented in confluence including:

1.  Which artefacts need to be reviewed and under what circumstances?
2.  What style of review is required for different artefacts/circumstances? (E.g. walkthrough, inspection, audit)
3.  What are the details of the review to be conducted? (See, for example, code reviews in the Bitbucket checklist)

5.  Other V&V activities: where activities other than testing and reviews have been used (e.g. prototyping in target technology), this should be documented in Confluence.
