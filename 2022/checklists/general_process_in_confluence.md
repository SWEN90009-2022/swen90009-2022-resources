1.  Team roles, the individuals filling them, and the high-level responsibilities of the roles.
2.  The team will hold a team meeting at least once per week. A document should be maintained for each such meeting, including agenda (describing the main discussion topics and built collaboratively before the meeting) and meeting minutes (describing the main decisions made and the action items assigned to specific team members or for entry in JIRA).
3.  Up-to-date risk tracking table (maintained and updated as required by the team at team meetings)
4.  Separate to their regular team meetings, the team will hold and document sprint planning, sprint review and sprint retrospective meetings for each sprint.
5.  To ensure team members are aware of each otherâ€™s progress, the team will hold stand-up meetings at least twice per week, either face-to-face or electronically. These meetings do not need to be documented.
6.  All product related communication from the Client should be captured in the Confluence requirements space.
