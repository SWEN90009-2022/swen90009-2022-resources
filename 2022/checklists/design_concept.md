# Design Concept

_Your aim is to ensure that the following items are provided:_

1.  A high-level design concept diagram (block diagram or UML component diagram), describing the high-level components of the system, including external systems, and their relationships (interfaces/interactions). (This should eventually evolve into a representation of your architecture.)
2.  A list of the main technologies supporting both the overall concept and components: this must include the implementation technologies, but may also include development environment and support technologies, such as for testing.
3.  An associated reuse plan indicates for each component in the design concept, which can be provided through reuse, which are to be developed for purpose, and which will be provided though a mix of these; the details of libraries, components, or other elements being reused need to be included.
4.  References to learning resources to bring the team up to speed on any of the items above, e.g. tutorial on a development environment, reference for a framework, documentation for a component library.
5.  The equivalent of a design notebook: at least the reasons for the choices made in deciding on the above elements, but better still the process undertaken in deciding this. That is, while it is useful to know why you ended up choosing a component or technology, it can be more informative to also know what alternatives were considered, and how all the options were evaluated.
