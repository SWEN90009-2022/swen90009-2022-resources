## Confluence Instructions
**All artefacts to be assessed will be placed as pages inside a page called** ***Specification***, hanging from the root page of your Confluence space. **You are expected to deliver 2 artefacts (Project Overview, Requirements Elicitation) as part of this submission.**

*Remember: The teaching team and your supervisor should be able to easily find information on your Confluence space. You’re also assessed by the way you organise your space so make sure your Confluence Space is clear and organized. Information architecture is key! You are more than welcome to constantly improve your project space.*


## Project Overview
Describe the project background (motivation), problem and the scope of the solution. Its purpose is to be the initial brief for semester 2 students (SWEN90014). The background should always reflect the latest shared understanding with the client (***keep it updated***). Keep it clear. Review your English and your texts. This is a VERY important task.

Stored in a sub-page called **Project Overview**, under **Specification. These names/labels can change depending on the task you performed during workshop #1. You are welcome to update and improve the current names of pages on Confluence.**

| Criteria | Quality attributes |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The students have produced a description of the project that accurately and adequately defines the motivation of the project, the problem and outlines the scope of the solution. |
| Presentation | The background document is clearly laid out and well structured. The document contains no typos or spelling errors. |


## Requirements Elicitation
Explain the requirements elicitation techniques you will use in your project. In case of interviews (for example), how you will prepare for your first interview with your client? List the resources you will use and briefly describe your process/guidelines.

Again, taking interview as an example: How you will structure your interview? List the questions your team will use as a guideline. Are there any problems to be addressed? Are you assigning different roles and responsibilities for each team member?

In short, explain your methods and list the artefacts you have designed/created to help you with your requirements elicitation.

Stored in a page called **Requirements Elicitation**, under **Specification**.

| Criteria | Quality attributes |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The students have produced an interview guide that explains their methods and roles/responsibilities. |
| Presentation | The interview guide contains no typos or spelling errors. The document is well organized/structured and lists their questions and strategies to help them understanding the requirements of the system. The interview questions are well-suited/contextualized to their project/client. |


## GitHub
**Structure your folders as detailed below:**

├── docs/                    # Documentation files (you can create subfolders here to organize your requirements and meeting minutes)

├── tests/                    # Automated tests

├── prototypes/low fidelity/     # low fidelity files (screens, mockups and so on)

├── prototypes/high fidelity/     # high fidelity files (screens, source files and so on)

├── ui/                        # All the images created for the prototypes (icons, fonts, backgrounds... should be here. This is different from the prototypes' folders.  These are the graphical elements that goes into the prototypes)

├── data samples/      # Documents you need to generate with all the data (inputs) necessary to simulate/demonstrate your prototype (whatever can be provided as an input in your prototype) 

└── README.md

**You don't need to have data in these folders every Sprint. For example, you will only have resources in prototypes/high fidelity/ folder in Sprint 4. Before that, this folder can exist in your GitHub but it'll be empty. This is an incremental process.**

At the end of each sprint, generate a BASELINE TAG from your repository (master branch).

Format: **SWEN90009_2021_<TwoDigits>_<Team>_BL_<sprint> - BL means BASELINE. A baseline is a reference point in the software development life cycle marked by the completion and formal approval of a set of predefined work products**

**Example of TAG in this subject: SWEN90009_2021_CM_Wombat_BL_SPRINT1**

This tag includes ALL the branches that were developed and completed during this Sprint.

Add a release notes to your README (list the branches that were included in that version).
