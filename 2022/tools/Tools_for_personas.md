# Tools for personas

There are many different tools you can use to create your personas. In this tutorial, we will introduce 4 tools to you.


## Hubspot - Make My Persona

### Features
Firstly, you do NOT need a Hubspot account to use this tool. Visit [this link](https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona).

Once you click the button, it will take you through a 7-steps tour to create your persona. (Image 2) 

Or, you can just choose to skip walkthrough mode and edit it yourself.

Either way, you will get the chance to edit/add/delete sections at the end. 


### Save and Export
Yes - you can save this persona and edit it later. What you do is: 
1. Click the save button
2. It will ask you to fill in some personal details
3. Then you can generate a PDF, as well as a link that you can share around or access it next time to continue edit your persona. 

### Not ideal
For the persona photo, you can only use a pre-defined set of avatar (around 15 choices) - no real images options. You cannot copy and paste photos either.

:exclamation: Be aware :exclamation:: If you search for Hubspot persona on Google, you might find [this tutorial](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts/create-and-edit-personas). This is **VERY DIFFERENT** to the Make My Persona tool. Please don't use this one. 



## PersonaGenerator
This tool is pretty straight-forward.  After you visit [this link](https://personagenerator.com/), you can start creating your persona by filling in content.

### Save and Export
- You get two links: one is view-only, one allows editing. You can share the two links in your team to edit/view your personas.
- You can print the persona as a PDF. 

### Not ideal
You **cannot** change the section title, add a new section or delete a section. In other words, the sections you can have on your persona are fixed. Please consider this before you choose this tool. 



## UXPRESSIA
To use this tool, create an account with UXPRESSIA for free. Visit [this link](https://uxpressia.com/personas-online-tool).

Then, create a project. In your project, you can create your persona. 

Uxpressia allows you to be very flexible with your sections - you can add/delete them, and there are different types of sections to choose from (e.g. text, sliders). 

### Not ideal
The following restrictions are limitations of a free plan:
1. You can only create one persona per account. 
2. You can only export it as a PNG.
3. To share your persona, you need to share your project first. The free plan only let you share your project with 1 person via email. 



## Xtensio

Visit [this link](https://xtensio.com/user-persona-template/) to start exploring.

### Not ideal
The following restrictions are limitations of a free plan:
1. You cannot share the work with anyone.
2. You cannot download it as a PNG or PDF.
3. Your work expires after a couple of hours. 

We do not recommend the free version of this tool due to the above limitations. It is not enough to support what you need in this project.  If your team has explored other tools and decided that you want to use this one, check out their [pricing](https://xtensio.com/pricing/?_gl=1*rkelh8*_ga*OTU0NjY3MjY3LjE2NDIzOTQ0ODE.*_ga_EFSR9CLTP4*MTY0MjM5NDQ4MC4xLjEuMTY0MjM5NTU2Mi41Nw..).
