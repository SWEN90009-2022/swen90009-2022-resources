## Set up
1. Sign up for free on Miro website.
2. Once you have signed up, Miro will let you set up your team.
   - There might be some teams that you can join in your organisation already - but that's not what we need. In this subject, you will need to create your own project team. Click "+ Create a new team" option to set up your own team.
   - Set up your team and answer a short survey from Miro
   - Invite your team members

## Tips before you start
### Number of editable boards
For a free account, your team only has 3 editable boards. Once you create more than 3 boards, only the 3 most recently created ones are editable.

How to make sure that you do not run out of boards? You can draw multiple diagrams on one board, and put each diagram inside a frame.

### Frame
Frame can help you organise your board, especially if you run out of boards and decide to put multiple diagrams in one board. Also, if you want to export your board to a PDF, it is essential that you put content inside a frame (each frame will be a single page on the PDF). 

How to add a frame: 

### Template
Miro has a library of templates to help you get started with your task. There are two main ways to explore and add templates:
1. In your team's main page, you should see a list of templates suggestion. Click on a template to create a new board with the chosen template.

2. Open a board you have already created, and add a new template in. This might be your preferred method if you are on a free plan and only the 3 most recently created boards are editable.


## Use Miro for Brainstorming
1. Write down the question that needs to be solved on your board.

2. Add the "Brainwriting" template to your board. You will find that the sticky notes are already created for you, ready to be filled in. (You don't have to start with any template. Feel free to start with an empty board and create sticky notes as you run the brain storm session)

3. When you are done with ideas generation, you can start to categorise ideas together. 
   - Adding tag to your sticky notes can help you categorise your ideas:
   - You can add comments to the ideas:
   - The final result may look like this:

1. Export as an image
