# CoachingMate

Coachingmate is a cloud based eco system that provides an efficient and effective way for sports, sports teams, coaches, trainers, personal trainers, medial sports professionals, individuals and groups the means to deliver programs/instruction and track the gains made by individuals.

We (the human race) are a race of achievers but how do we achieve? Coachingmate provides the mentor (the coach/instructor) with convenient tools to deliver instruction to their participant seamlessly via a white labelled web based, IOS or Android platform. The instruction is filled with Meta data for the individuals to follow and achieve, the athleteâ€™s data is fed back to the coaches and individuals dashboards for analysis. Excitingly CoachingMate is now adopting prediction models to assist coach and individual reach their goals more effectively.

As a secondary project we are building a standalone social media platform purely for sports enthusiasts. All communication will be handled via our new this platform including the ability to create groups, team, events, follow and be followed, post, like, comment and much more.

The above gives to a scope of our overall project, below is your opportunity.

We are excited this year to be giving the students the opportunity to develop a critical piece of our ongoing projects at CoachingMate.

We will be rewriting our workout builder withing CoachingMate, This handles the actual instruction withing a workout as well as all the meta data associated to that workout. The purpose is to make the construction of a workout faster and easier for the prescriber using drag and drop visual tools rather than writing out in great detail.

Secondly is to make this system compatible with our developed Garmin watch app. Creating this link will allow individuals to upload their instructions for the week directly to their Garmin wearable device and follow along with prompts from that device.

Successfully developing this project will increase the features of CoachingMate significantly for both coach and athletes.

We hope this excites your interest.
