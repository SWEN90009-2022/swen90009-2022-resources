# Workshop 4

## Before the Tutorial Begins

By now, all teams should have:

1. Had your first client meeting.
2. Developed and validated your motivational model with the client.
3. Read about agile methodology and task tracking in the [guides](../guides).

*Please see [workshop 3](workshop_3.md) for more information*.

## Today's Workshop

### Purpose

The purpose of workshop 4 is to learn about the key components of working in an Agile Scrum team.

### Working in an Agile team

In this subject, teams are required to follow the Agile mindset, and the development process should follow the Scrum 
framework (a framework used to be Agile). Agile refers to a mindset that allows teams to focus on being able to respond 
to change rapidly by focusing on people rather than tools and well-defined processes. By ensuring it can adapt to
change quickly, Agile helps teams maximise the value delivered to clients.

### Scrum

Scrum focuses on ensuring teams work together by focusing on delivering high-priority tasks in short time boxed periods 
called sprints. Scrum prioritises teamwork, transparency, and continuous improvement. Let's look at how it works.

### Scrum Team and Roles

When working in a scrum team, there is a high level of communication among team members. This allows the team to have a 
shared understanding of the goal, have good transparency of each other's work, but also consistently reflect on team 
performance to strive for improvement. To ensure that a Scrum team is able to achieve this, there are three key
roles that are necessary:

| Role                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scrum Master            | Manages the Scrum process by coaching the team towards achieving their goals (sprint goals).                                                                                                                             |
| Product Owner           | Manages the product backlog using their strong understanding of the project. Acts as the intermediary between the development team and the client, and represents the interests of the client when they are not present. |
| Development Team Member | The people in charge of implementing the project. In your projects, all team members should be contributing to the coding of the system.                                                                                 |

The development team can be broken down further into several other roles that represent important considerations of 
your project:

- **Frontend Lead**: Responsible for key frontend decisions, setting up the frontend repository
- **Backend Lead**: Responsible for key backend decisions, setting up the backend repository
- **Quality Assurance/Testing Lead**: Maintains the testing plan, and ensures the team takes the necessary actions to 
achieve testing objectives.

#### Deciding Your Team Roles

In your teams, you should determine who would like to take on each of the roles mentioned above. You can choose to 
rotate your roles, but it is preferred to keep a consistent Product Owner throughout the project to make client 
communication streamlined. When considering roles, think about:

- What role do your skills align well with?
- What role are you interested in?

Once you have selected your roles, document this in Confluence. We recommend you also include the key 
responsibilities/tasks for each of your roles on Confluence. This ensures that you all have a clear understanding 
of what is expected of each role.

#### Scrum Ceremonies

The Scrum framework has several ceremonies that facilitate determining what work is to be completed in a sprint, 
along with understanding how the team is performing.

| Ceremony             | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sprint planning      | Team plans the upcoming sprint by estimating the difficulty of tasks at the top of the product backlog. Once the team has estimated enough tasks for the upcoming sprint, the tasks are pulled into the upcoming sprint's backlog. |
| Stand-up             | A check-in to assess what work has been done and any roadblocks faced by team members. Provides transparency.                                                                                                                      |
| Sprint review        | Show stakeholders what was accomplished in a sprint.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Sprint retrospective | Reflect on the team's performance through understanding what retrospective went well, what didn't work well and brainstorming actions to help improve how the team works.                                                          |

A more detailed guide of the ceremonies is available in [guides](../guides).

#### Conducting Your First Sprint Planning Meeting

Once you have all your prioritised user stories, teams can complete their first sprint planning meeting. The product 
owner should spend some time to ensure that the backlog is up-to-date with the most important tasks at the top. Once 
complete, the sprint planning meeting can begin. Please note that this example will use a variant of planning poker for
the estimation of tasks.

1. Product owner presents product backlog
2. Discussions with the team about high priority features, which are then broken down into smaller tasks. This can 
include segregating frontend and backend work for user stories, or breaking down frontend work into pages/components
3. The product owner should ask all team members to either say or type their estimate for the task using the Fibonacci 
scale, where 1 represents straightforward simple tasks and higher Fibonacci numbers represent complex tasks.
4. Once all team members have given an estimate, the team can discuss their reasons for a higher/lower estimate than 
their peers.
5. After discussion, the team should endeavour to reach a consensus on what the final estimate should be. This estimate 
is then updated on the task tracking tool.
6. Team agrees on the tasks set out for the sprint, and tasks are moved to the sprint backlog.
7. Create a page in Confluence to document the sprint planning meeting, including the process followed and the outcome.
