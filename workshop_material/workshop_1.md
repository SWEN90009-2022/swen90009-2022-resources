# Workshop 1

## Today's Workshop

### Purpose

The purpose of workshop 1 is to introduce yourself as a Supervisor, and to get your teams set-up with their communications channel, GitHub, etc.

1. Introduce yourself
2. Ask each student to introduce themselves
3. Ice-breaker activity
4. Discuss assessments
5. Form groups
6. As a group, team should discuss and decide:
   1. Communication application to use. Some examples are [Slack](https://www.slack.com), [Discord](https://www.discord.com).
   2. Weekly team meetings. [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com) is a good tool for finding availabilities.
   3. Code repository. In this subject we use GitHub.
   To learn more about GitHub, please see the [GitHub Guide](../guides/github.md).  
   4. Document repository. You can use any tool of your choice, but [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) is the industry standard and a great tool to learn.  
   5. Task tracking (OPTIONAL). You can use any tool of your choice, but the most popular tools are: [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) or [Trello](https://trello.com/home).  
   Trello is quicker to set up and use, but JIRA is the industry standard.  
   To learn more about task tracking, you can refer to [Task Tracking Guide](../guides/task_tracking.md).

> Make sure you invite your Supervisor to your communications, code repository, task tracking, and document repository
> applications. Most Supervisor-team communication outside of tutorials will take place on the chosen communications 
> channel. Your supervisor will also require access to your repositories in order to mark your work.

## Extra Resources

As always, you can find additional information in [Guides](../../for_canvas/guides).
